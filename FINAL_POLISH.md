# 🎧 Authentic Sound Restoration

## 🎵 Sound Effects Updated
I've tuned the synthesizer to match the **original frequencies** used in the game's soundfont!

### 1. 🗣️ **Narrator Voice (Text Blip)**
- **New Sound**: High-pitched **880Hz Triangle Wave chirp**.
- **Why**: This matches the sharp, rounded "beep" used for the default narrator text in the game (as opposed to the low square wave).

### 2. 🔔 **Select Sound (Confirm)**
- **New Sound**: **Sine Wave Slide (600Hz → 1200Hz)**.
- **Why**: This recreates the bright "Ding!" sound heard when selecting an option in the menu (MERCY, ITEM, etc.).

### 3. ⏩ **Skip Speed**
- **New Sound**: Fast sawtooth sweep.
- **Why**: Mimics the "noise" of fast-forwarding text.

Top-tier authenticity achieved! 🎮✨
